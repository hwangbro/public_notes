# Pokemon Red 2025 Tournament Tech Setup (In Progress)

## OBS Scene Setup
A portable OBS setup will be provided to all racers to use and populate.

At least 24 hours before your first tournament race, all runners must get their setup checked by one of the organizers or restream volunteers to ensure that everything is working properly.
