# Cubing PBs

Here are my current best times for different averages. My goal is to get my Ao1000 down to sub-15 seconds.
 
Ao = Average of. Removes the best and worst times and takes the mean of the remaining.
For example, Ao5 means out of 5 solves, you remove the best and worst times, and average the remaining 3.
Ao12 solves means out of 12 solves, you remove the best and worst times, and average the remaining 10.
Competitions often use Ao5, not fastest singles to determine who wins.
