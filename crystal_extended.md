## Pokemon Crystal Rt29 Extended FAQ

### What does extended mean?
- The current route does a manip at the beginning of Route 29 to get to Mr. Pokemon's house without any encounters.
- Theoretically, perfectly clearing all the textboxes in the cutscene allows us to manipulate no encounters on Route 30, and potentially even turn 1 of the Rival fight

### How many textboxes do you have to clear perfectly?
- Rough count is around 50 textboxes in the cutscene

### Is it frame perfect to clear textboxes?
- In Gen 2, it's a 5 frame window to clear a textbox, 6 frame window to clear "end of paragraph" textbox

### Why are the textboxes changing colors?
- I am playing on a ROM to practice clearing the textboxes perfectly. If textbox turns red, that means I failed in clearing that textbox

### New route??
- The overall route is still the same, but this idea has potential to allow me to consistently get better Falkner RNG (no encounters, Leer T1 from Rival, Mikey crit)

### Will you do runs?
- I don't intend to do runs until this re-routing/practicing is done.

### If you aren't doing runs, what are you going to be doing instead?
