## Pokemon Crystal Rt29 Extended FAQ

### What does extended mean?
- The current route does a single RNG manipulation that starts with generating a Totodile with perfect stats and ends when you enter Falkner's gym.
- This manip "extends" the standard Totodile manip into no encounters on R29, R30, getting a perfect Rival1 fight, no encounters on R29 pass 2, getting a perfect Mikey fight, and no encounters on R30/R31

### How many textboxes do you have to clear perfectly?
- Rough count is around 160 including all the battle and nickname inputs.

### Is it frame perfect to clear textboxes?
- In Gen 2, it's a 5 frame window to clear a textbox, 6 frame window to clear "end of paragraph" textbox

### Why are the textboxes sometimes changing colors?
- I am playing on a ROM to practice clearing the textboxes perfectly. If textbox turns red, that means I failed in clearing that textbox

### New route??
- The overall route is still the same, but this idea allows me to get truly ridiculous Falkner times (top end with these strats is currently around 13:3x)
